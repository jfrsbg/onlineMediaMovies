This is a website template that was in adobe XD and i transformed in a React Project. You can follow the link to see the adobe xd file in this website: https://dribbble.com/shots/11040194-Online-Media-services-provider-landing-page.

I'm not a designer, I'm a developer, so, just because I don't want to waste my time thinking in UI/UX I just got this template on internet and transformed it in a real website.<br>
